Custom configurations for Karabiner

Karabiner is an open source keyboard customizer that allows you to change key
assignments on internal or external keyboards. You can make simple key remapping
changes, or configure what Karabiner refers to as "complex configurations", which
can modify combinations of keys, or even what a key is assigned to base on how
long it is pressed.

## Getting Karabiner

* https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/

## Compatibility

The modifications provided here are compatible with Karabiner 11.6.0 and above.

## Installing modifications

* [Start importing modifications][import]

Basic key mapping can be changed through the Karabiner UI, but complex modifications
must be installed by directly editing the `karabiner.json` file created by
Karabiner, or by importing them through specially formatted karabiner app URLS
that use the `karabiner://` URL scheme.

The `import.html` file in this repo provides import links in this format.

_GithHub doesn't allow custom link URL schemes, so this file loads in GitHub's
HTML preview mode._

* If this doesn't work for you, download the `import.html` file and open it in a
browser
